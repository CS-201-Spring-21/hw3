- understand the trie data structure and its related operations
- understand the inverted index data structure and its related operations
- be comfortable with object oriented programming
- be comfortable with programming in a high level language, preferably `python`
- be able to problem solve

## The Problem Set

The problem as well as your tasks are described are in `hw3.tex` which is to be compiled using a LaTeX compiler.

## Time Requirement.

## Submission

There are 3 parts to this assignment. Lack of submission of any part will result in a loss of marks.

## 3.1 Solving the Problem Set

Please solve the problem and complete your tasks as indicated in the problem sheet and push the relevant files to your GitHub repository. Any files in the repository at the time of the deadline will be considered as your submission. As your submission will be partly graded by your peers, please do not include identifying information in it.

This is a team submission and the earned score is the team's _Submission Score_. It is computed as per the accompanying _hw3-review.xlsx_.

Deadline: 2359h on Sunday, 21 March

## 3.2 Feedback

You have to provide feedback on your team and on the assignment by filling the feedback form which will be made available as _HW 3.2_ under the _Assignments_ module on the course page. This is due at the same time as the problem solutions.

This is an individual submission. Submitting it contibutes to your individual _Team Factor_ which is a fraction between 0 and 1.

Deadline: 2359h on Sunday, 21 March

## 2.3 Peer Review

Two submissions will be shared with you for review which you will evaluate and score according to the rubric outlined in the accompanying _hw3-review.xlsx_. You will submit a filled copy of the rubric for each submission against _HW 3.3_ which will be made available under the _Assignments_ module on the course page.

This is an individual submission. Submitting it contibutes to your individual _Review Factor_ which is a fraction between 0 and 1.

Deadline: 2359h on Monday, 29 March

# Grading

Your individual score is computed as the product of:
- your team's _Submission Score_
- your individual _Team Factor_
- your individual _Review Factor_

The Submission Score is based on the content of your repository and graded as per the rubric file.

Your Team Factor is 1 by default and is penalized in the following cases:
- lack of timely submission of HW 3.2
- lack of contribution to the team as indicated by your buddy
- lack of evidence of contribution to the team as indicated on GitHub

Your Review Factor is 1 by default and is penalized in the following cases:
- lack of timely submission of HW 3.3
- bad reviews
